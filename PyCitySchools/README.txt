Written Report (15 points)
To receive all points, the written report presents a cohesive written analysis that:

Summarizes the analysis (5 points)

	Top 5 schools were all charter schools, each with >90% passing rate.
	Bottom 5 schools were all public district schools, each with scores
	below 54%.
	Overall, math scores were lower than reading scores for both charter
	and public schools.
	Although school funding may vary, both school types dedicated similar
	amounts of money to individual student budgets.
	Large schools (2000-5000 students) all reported lower-than-average
	test scores, with the lowest passing rates (58%).

Draws two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations (10 points)

	Schools with smaller student populations can expect higher test scores,
	regardless of school type or per-student budget (<1000, 89.88% ; 1000-2000,
	90.62% ; 2000-5000 58.28%).
	Moreover, schools that allocated smaller budgets to students earned a higher
	passing rate, outperforming schools that dedicated signigicantly more money towards
	students. This implies budget is not necessarily tied towards the quality of instruction
	(<$585, 90.36% ; $585-630, 81.41% ; $630-645, 62.85% ; $654-680, 53.52%).
